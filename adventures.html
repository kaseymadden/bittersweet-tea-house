      <h2>Work In Progress: Life Grows from All Places</h2>
      <p>Giving a title to one of my pieces is always a struggle. I shuffle back and forth trying to decide what each piece wants to be called. No matter how many times I ask the women in my pieces, they always insist that giving them a name will minimize their impact. So I settle for vague descriptions of them, because for me, naming a piece "Untitled" is lazy.<p>There is something so beautifully complex about mushrooms. I love how they pop-up over night, as if by magic. They show up like a family on vacation, peeking their heads out of their home, and presenting themselves to the universe. Mushrooms can be edible, decorative, or deadly. It's hard to trust a mushroom . . . they're like people in that way.</p></p>

    <h3><em>Kasey creates feminist art through an exploration of fluidity in gender. Her focus is on strong, fierce, unique women.  Women in art are often depicted as soft, vulnerable, and nude; their gaze cast away from the viewer. The women Kasey creates captivate the viewer with their intense, unsmiling and unabashed stare.</em></h3>
    <h3><em>
      Anime, body modification, and natural elements are key themes in her work. She utilizes blank or basic backgrounds to bring focus to her characters.
